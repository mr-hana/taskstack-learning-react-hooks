# Task stack
Repository for learning React Hooks.

Assign a task to a schedule.

Although it is not sufficient as a schedule creation, development is terminated because it has begun to deviate from Hooks study.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Features
* Edit term.
* Add task.
* Display tasks.
* Generate a calendar of term.
  * Assign task from tasks to schedule.
  * Saturdays and Sundays are excluded from the schedule.

## Todo
* Edit task.
* Sort tasks.
* Set a specified date for task.
* Export and import tasks.
* CSS for schedule printing.
* Set holiday.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
